# Instruction

1. Take the data, and create one or more code blocks. You should finish with a data frame that contains a subset of the columns in your selected dataset. If there is an obvious target (aka predictor or independent) variable, you should include this in your set of columns. You should include (or add if necessary) meaningful column names and replace (if necessary) any non-intuitive abbreviations used in the data that you selected. For example, if you had instead been tasked with working with the UCI mushroom dataset, you would include the target column for edible or poisonous, and transform “e” values to “edible.” Your deliverable is the R code to perform these transformation tasks.

2. Make sure that the original data file is accessible through your code—for example, stored in a GitHub repository or AWS S3 bucket and referenced in your code. If the code references data on your local machine, then your work is not reproducible!

3. Start your R Markdown document with a two to three sentence “Overview” or “Introduction” description of what the article that you chose is about, and include a link to the article.

4. Finish with a “Conclusions” or “Findings and Recommendations” text block that includes what you might do to extend, verify, or update the work from the selected article.

5. Each of your text blocks should minimally include at least one header, and additional non-header text.

6. You’re of course welcome—but not required--to include additional information, such as exploratory data
analysis graphics (which we will cover later in the course).
