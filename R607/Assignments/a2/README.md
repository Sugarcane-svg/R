# intro

This assignment will be splited into two parts. The first part is about database setup and restore data by an existing file instead of entering data manually. The second part of it is about connecting R with PostgreSQL and make queries from R to fetch the info in corresponding database. 

*For the first part(**database_setup.txt**): I don't have Postgres GUI installed, instead, I have installed PostgreSQL from home-brew, therefore, the code should be run in the terminal

*For the second part(**a_2.Rmd**): it runs in RStudio
