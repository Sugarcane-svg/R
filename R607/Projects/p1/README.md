# Project 1

## Target
Your job is to create an R Markdown file that generates a .CSV file (that could for example be imported into a SQL database).

## Requirements
1. you're given a text file with chess tournament results where the information has some structure
2. file format should be: player's name, player's state, total number of points, player's pre-rating, and average pre chess rating of opponents. (e.g. GARY HUA, ON, 6.0, 1794, 1605)


## Tips
1605 was calculated by using the pre-tournament opponentsâ€™ ratings of 1436, 1563, 1600, 1610, 1649, 1663, 1716, and dividing by the total number of games played
